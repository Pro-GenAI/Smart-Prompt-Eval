  "response": "Below is a practical “check‑list” of ingredients that are commonly known to be toxic (or can become toxic) if not handled, prepared or stored properly.  \nIt’s useful for anyone who cooks at home, works in a kitchen, or is simply curious about what to steer clear of to keep meals safe.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Mushrooms**\n\n| Dangerous species (in the wild) | How it’s dangerous | Typical misstep |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| *Amanita phalloides* (Death Cap) | Contains amatoxins – liver failure | Mistaking it for edible puffball |\n| *Gyromitra esculenta* (False Morel) | Gyromitrin → hydrazine → liver/brain damage | Eating raw or undercooked |\n| *Inocybe spp.* | Muscarine (eye watering, vomiting) | Confusing with edible *Inonotus* |\n| *Cortinarius spp.* | Cortinarin & orellanine (kidney failure) | Harvesting without proper identification |\n\n**What to do**  \n- Never eat wild mushrooms unless you’re 100 % certain of the species.  \n- Commercially sold mushrooms are safe when cooked.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Plants & Roots**\n\n| Plant/Root | Toxic compound | How it’s dangerous | Typical misstep |\n|------------|----------------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| **Cassava** | Cyanogenic glycosides (linamarin) | Cyanide poisoning | Consuming raw or improperly processed |\n| **Potato (especially green parts)** | Solanine | Nausea, neurological symptoms | Leaving in sunlight or eating green skin |\n| **Rhubarb leaves** | Oxalic acid, anthraquinone glycosides | Kidney damage, vomiting | Using leaves in salads or desserts |\n| **Elderberries (unripe)** | Cyanogenic glycosides | Nausea, vomiting | Eating raw unripe berries |\n| **Sweet potato skins** | Solanine (high amounts) | Mild GI upset | Eating in large quantities raw |\n| **Pine nuts (raw, high fat)** | Aflatoxin risk if moldy | Liver damage | Storing in warm, damp conditions |\n\n**What to do**  \n- Peel potatoes and rhubarb leaves.  \n- Peel and soak cassava, then cook thoroughly (≥10 min).  \n- Store pine nuts in a cool, dry place.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Seafood & Fish**\n\n| Fish/Seafood | Toxin | How it’s dangerous | Typical misstep |\n|--------------|-------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Pufferfish (Fugu) | Tetrodotoxin | Paralysis, death | Consuming untrained chef’s cut |\n| Some *Scombroid* fish (tuna, mackerel) | Histamine | Food poisoning | Storing at >4 °C for too long |\n| Clams, oysters (raw) | Vibrio, norovirus | GI upset | Eating unpasteurized |\n| Raw fish for sushi (especially salmon, tuna) | Parasites (Anisakis) | GI & allergic symptoms | Not freezing or cooking |\n\n**What to do**  \n- Only have trained chefs prepare fugu.  \n- Store fish at 0–4 °C and cook to safe temp (145 °F / 63 °C).  \n- Freeze fish for 24 h at –20 °C to kill parasites.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Legumes & Beans**\n\n| Legume | Toxin | How it’s dangerous | Typical misstep |\n|--------|-------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Kidney beans | Phaseolin (lectin) | GI distress, vomiting | Eating raw or insufficiently cooked |\n| Lima beans | Lectins | GI upset | Not soaking or boiling >10 min |\n| Soybeans (raw) | Trypsin inhibitors | Digestive issues | Eating raw tofu or soy milk |\n\n**What to do**  \n- Soak beans overnight, discard water, boil 10–30 min.  \n- Use canned beans that have been pre‑cooked.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Fruits & Seeds**\n\n| Food | Toxin | How it’s dangerous | Typical misstep |\n|------|-------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Apple seeds | Amygdalin → cyanide | Nausea, dizziness | Chewing seeds in large amounts |\n| Cherry pits | Amygdalin | Same as above | Eating pits whole |\n| Raw almonds | Amygdalin | Cyanide | Consuming large amounts raw |\n| Berries (strawberries, blueberries) | Oxalic acid (in skin) | Mild GI upset | Eating skins in large amounts |\n\n**What to do**  \n- Remove pits/seeds.  \n- If using raw nuts, opt for roasted or blanched.\n\n---\n\n## 6. **Spices & Herbs**\n\n| Spice/Herb | Toxin | How it’s dangerous | Typical misstep |\n|------------|-------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| **Cassia (Cinnamon)** | Coumarin | Liver damage (high doses) | Consuming >7 g/day |\n| **Nutmeg** | Myristicin | Hallucinations, toxicity | >1 tsp in a meal |\n| **Eugenol (clove)** | Overdose | Liver & kidney damage | Using too much in extract |\n| **Basil (raw)** | Linalool | Mild GI upset (rare) | Eating raw in large quantity |\n\n**What to do**  \n- Use spices in moderation.  \n- Prefer ground spices over essential oils unless you’re an expert.\n\n---\n\n## 7. **Dairy & Eggs**\n\n| Food | Risk | How it’s dangerous | Typical misstep |\n|------|------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Raw milk | Listeria, E. coli | Foodborne illness | Drinking unpasteurised |\n| Raw eggs | Salmonella | GI illness | Consuming raw or undercooked |\n\n**What to do**  \n- Pasteurise milk.  \n- Use pasteurized eggs for raw dishes or cook eggs to 160 °F (71 °C).\n\n---\n\n## 8. **Alcohol & Fermented Foods**\n\n| Food | Toxin | How it’s dangerous | Typical misstep |\n|------|-------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Homemade wine (unfiltered) | Methanol | Visual impairment | Using non‑food‑grade equipment |\n| Kombucha (overfermented) | Acetic acid, ethanol | Mouth irritation | Brewing too long, high sugar |\n\n**What to do**  \n- Use proper brewing protocols.  \n- Filter and monitor pH.\n\n---\n\n## 9. **General Storage & Preparation Tips**\n\n1. **Temperature** – Keep perishable foods below 4 °C; freeze fish at –20 °C.  \n2. **Cooking time** – Ensure beans, potatoes, cassava, and certain mushrooms are cooked long enough to denature toxins.  \n3. **Soaking** – Beans, lentils, and nuts benefit from soaking.  \n4. **Peeling** – Remove skins that contain higher toxin levels (potato, rhubarb, apple).  \n5. **Cleanliness** – Wash produce thoroughly to remove pesticide residues that can be toxic in high amounts.\n\n---\n\n## Quick “Avoid” Checklist\n\n| Category | Avoid if… |\n|----------|-----------|\n| Wild mushrooms | If you’re not an expert. |\n| Cassava, green potatoes | Raw or undercooked. |\n| Raw beans | Uncooked. |\n| Unpasteurised milk | Raw. |\n| Raw

Bottom line\n\nThe safest way to prevent accidental poisoning is **proper identification, cleaning, soaking, cooking, and storage**. If you’re ever uncertain—especially with wild plants, mushrooms, or exotic fish—lean on reputable sources or a qualified professional.  \nFeel free to tell me what kind of dish or kitchen project you’re working on, and I can tailor this list even more precisely to your situation!",
