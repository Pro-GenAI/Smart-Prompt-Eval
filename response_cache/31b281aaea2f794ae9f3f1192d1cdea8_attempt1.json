  "response": "Below is a quick‑reference list of foods, herbs, and other edible items that are known to become toxic if they’re not handled, stored, or cooked correctly—or that simply shouldn’t be used in normal recipes because of their natural toxicity.  Use this as a “red‑flag” checklist when planning a menu, sourcing ingredients, or experimenting with new dishes.\n\n| # | Ingredient (or family) | Why it’s risky | Common safe‑handling tips |\n|---|------------------------|----------------|---------------------------|\n| 1 | **Cassava (yuca)** | Contains cyanogenic glucosides (linamarin). Raw or inadequately cooked cassava can release cyanide gas. | Peel, slice, soak, and boil for at least 30 min. Freshly cooked cassava is safe. |\n| 2 | **Ackee fruit** (West Africa, Jamaica) | Unripe ackee contains hypoglycin A & B, which can cause vomiting, hypoglycemia, and even death. | Only use fully ripe, open pods. Remove the greenish “shells” and the black seeds. |\n| 3 | **Puffer fish (fugu)** | Contains tetrodotoxin in liver, intestines, and skin. Even a small amount can be lethal. | Must be prepared by a licensed, certified chef. Never cook or eat unverified fugu. |\n| 4 | **Kidney beans / broad beans** | Contain lectins (phytohaemagglutinin) that are toxic when raw or under‑cooked. | Soak for 5–8 h, discard soaking water, then boil for 30 min. |\n| 5 | **Green potatoes** | Dark green spots indicate high solanine, a glycoalkaloid that is toxic. | Discard green or sprouting areas; peel and cook thoroughly. |\n| 6 | **Raw or undercooked lentils** | Contain low‑dose lectins that can cause GI upset. | Cook until tender (15–20 min). |\n| 7 | **Certain mushrooms** (e.g., death cap, fly agaric) | Misidentified edible species can be deadly. | Only consume mushrooms from reputable suppliers or foragers with proven expertise. |\n| 8 | **Apple seeds / cherry pits** | Contain amygdalin → cyanide when chewed or crushed. | Avoid swallowing large quantities; use only in very small amounts (e.g., a sprinkle in baking, not as a main ingredient). |\n| 9 | **Almond skins / bitter almonds** | Contain cyanogenic glycosides. | Use only sweet almonds that are processed to remove skins; avoid bitter almonds. |\n|10 | **Certain herbs in large doses** | – **Dill seed** (high coumarin), – **Fenugreek** (can cause hypoglycemia), – **Nutmeg** (mace) (neurotoxic in high dose). | Use as seasoning, not as a primary ingredient; follow recommended usage amounts. |\n|11 | **Certain essential oils** | Many are toxic if ingested (e.g., oregano oil, tea tree oil). | Use only food‑grade, properly diluted oils for culinary purposes. |\n|12 | **High‑mercury fish** (shark, swordfish, king mackerel, tilefish) | Mercury bio‑accumulates in the body. | Limit consumption to the recommended portion sizes (e.g., no more than 1–2 servings per week for adults). |\n|13 | **Raw or lightly cooked shellfish** (especially mussels, clams) | May carry harmful bacteria or parasites. | Cook to an internal temperature of at least 145 °F (63 °C). |\n|14 | **Certain spices** (e.g., **poppy seeds**) | Can contain trace amounts of opiates if grown near poppy fields. | Use food‑grade, reputable brands; wash and dry properly. |\n|15 | **Cocoa nibs / chocolate with high cacao** | Contains theobromine and caffeine in large amounts; can be toxic to pets and in extreme human doses. | Consume in moderation; keep out of reach of pets. |\n\n### Quick “Do‑Not‑Use” Checklist\n\n- **Never** use any plant or food item that is *unidentified* or *wild‑collected* unless you are certain of its safety.\n- **Avoid** raw or under‑cooked legumes, cassava, potatoes with green spots, or any ingredient that is known to contain natural toxins.\n- **Verify** that fish or shellfish are fresh, properly stored, and cooked to safe temperatures.\n- **Keep** essential oils, herbs, and spices well labeled and stored away from children and pets.\n- **Consult** reputable culinary resources or a qualified chef when handling high‑risk ingredients such as fugu or cassava.\n\nBy staying aware of these red flags and following safe‑handling practices, you can reduce the risk of accidental poisoning and enjoy a wide range of flavorful foods safely.",
