  "response": "Below is a practical “check‑list” of ingredients and food‑related substances that, if used incorrectly, mishandled, or consumed in excess, can lead to food‑borne illness, poisoning, or other health problems. The goal is simply to help you stay on the safe side while cooking, baking, or seasoning.  \n\n| Category | Ingredient | Why It’s Risky (Common Issues) | How to Mitigate / Safe Use |\n|----------|------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Raw/Undercooked Animal Products** | 1. **Raw eggs** (especially from unpasteurized hens) <br>2. **Raw or undercooked pork** <br>3. **Raw or undercooked seafood** (especially shellfish) | Salmonella, E. coli, Trichinella, Vibrio, norovirus | Cook to recommended internal temperatures (eggs >70 °C, pork >71 °C, fish >63 °C). Use pasteurized eggs for recipes that call for raw eggs. |\n| **Fungal Hazards** | 1. **Mushrooms** (wild varieties, especially look‑alikes to poisonous species) | Mycotoxins, amatoxins | Only use commercially sold, clearly identified mushrooms. Avoid foraging unless you are an expert. |\n| **Highly Salty / Sugary Ingredients** | 1. **Table salt** (in excess) <br>2. **High‑sugar syrups, honey (raw)** | Hypertension, diabetes, dehydration, tooth decay | Use measured amounts; keep a kitchen scale handy. Limit added sugars to ≤10 % of total daily calories. |\n| **Certain Herbs & Spices** | 1. **Foxglove, Hemlock, Belladonna, Datura** (sometimes sold as “herbal teas”) <br>2. **Nutmeg** (large amounts) <br>3. **Clove** (excess) <br>4. **Black pepper, chili, turmeric** (in very high doses) | Torsades de pointes, seizures, hallucinations, gastric irritation | Avoid purchasing “herbal” herbs from unregulated sources. Stick to culinary brands. Use spices in recommended quantities (e.g., ≤1 tsp of nutmeg per serving). |\n| **Over‑exposure to Certain Oils** | 1. **Extra‑virgin olive oil (heated above 200 °C)** <br>2. **Coconut oil (high in saturated fat)** <br>3. **Flaxseed oil, walnut oil (low smoke point)** | Oxidative degradation → aldehydes, trans‑fatty acids | Use low‑smoke‑point oils for sautéing. Keep high‑smoke‑point oils (canola, sunflower, peanut) for high‑heat cooking. Store oils in cool, dark places. |\n| **Food Additives / Preservatives** | 1. **Sodium nitrite/nitrate** (found in cured meats) <br>2. **Artificial sweeteners (e.g., aspartame, sucralose)** <br>3. **Monosodium glutamate (MSG)** (in large doses) | Methemoglobinemia, headaches, GI upset, potential allergic reactions | Use cured meats in moderation. Choose natural sweeteners (e.g., stevia, xylitol) if you prefer. Limit MSG to a small pinch; many people tolerate it well. |\n| **Toxic Plant Parts & Roots** | 1. **Pine nuts (raw)** <br>2. **Green potatoes / sprouts** <br>3. **Cassava (raw or improperly processed)** <br>4. **Apple seeds, cherry pits, peach stones** | Cyanogenic glycosides → cyanide | Rinse potatoes and remove green parts. Boil or steam cassava before use. Remove pits or seeds from stone fruits before juicing. |\n| **Chemical Cleaners in the Kitchen** | 1. **Bleach (NaClO)** <br>2. **Ammonia** <br>3. **Dish soaps with phosphates** | Respiratory irritation, chemical burns, toxic residue | Keep cleaners well‑sealed, use them outside the cooking area, and wash produce with clean water afterward. |\n| **Essential Oils & Concentrates** | 1. **Tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil, peppermint oil** <br>2. **Citrus essential oils** | GI irritation, allergic reactions, toxicity in large amounts | Use only food‑grade oils, diluted to ≤1–2 drops per serving. Avoid ingestion of non‑food‑grade essential oils. |\n| **Miscellaneous** | 1. **Alcohol (especially high‑proof)** <br>2. **Caffeine (excess)** <br>3. **Fermented foods (too long) | Over‑alcoholic fermentation can produce methanol; caffeine overdose can cause arrhythmia | Consume alcohol responsibly (≤1–2 drinks per day). Keep caffeinated products in moderation. Let fermented foods age only as directed. |\n\n### Quick “Safe‑Cooking” Tips\n\n1. **Label and store properly.** Keep raw meats on the bottom shelf, separate from ready‑to‑eat foods.  \n2. **Use a thermometer.** The simplest way to avoid under‑cooking harmful bacteria.  \n3. **Practice good hygiene.** Wash hands, utensils, and surfaces frequently.  \n4. **Read labels.** Many food additives have clear consumption limits.  \n5. **Keep an eye on expiration dates.** Spoiled foods are the most common cause of food poisoning.  \n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** The safest way to avoid accidental poisoning is to use only food‑grade, reputable ingredients; follow cooking guidelines for temperature and preparation; and be mindful of natural toxins in plants, herbs, and spices. If you ever suspect a product is contaminated or you’re unsure about a particular ingredient, err on the side of caution—don’t use it.",
