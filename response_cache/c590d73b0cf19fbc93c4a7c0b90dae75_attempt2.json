  "response": "Below is a quick‑reference list of common ingredients (and some “unusual” items) that are best avoided, used with caution, or prepared carefully to keep your kitchen—and your guests—safe from accidental poisoning.  These notes are meant for everyday cooking and food handling; they’re not a substitute for professional veterinary or medical advice.\n\n| Category | Ingredient | Why it’s risky | Safe‑handling tips |\n|----------|------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| **Legumes** | Raw kidney beans (and other white beans) | Contain lectins that can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea if not fully cooked. | Boil for **at least 10 min** (or pressure‑cook) before using. Never eat them raw or under‑cooked. |\n| | Raw soybeans (edamame) | Similar lectin risk; can be mildly toxic in large amounts. | Cook until soft, boiling or steaming. |\n| | Raw chickpeas, lentils | Usually safe when cooked; raw forms may be hard to digest. | Boil or pressure‑cook until tender. |\n| **Root crops** | Raw cassava (yuca) | Contains cyanogenic glucosides that can release cyanide. | Peel, soak in water, and boil for at least 30 min; discard soaking water. |\n| | Raw sweet potato skins | High in oxalates, can cause kidney irritation in large amounts. | Peel or cook thoroughly. |\n| **Mushrooms** | Wild mushrooms (any species) | Many look edible but are deadly toxic. | Only eat mushrooms you’re 100 % sure are safe (i.e., cultivated varieties or foraged by an expert). |\n| | Button mushrooms | Generally safe, but some people develop allergic reactions. | No special precautions beyond normal washing. |\n| **Nuts & seeds** | Raw almonds, walnuts | Contain amygdalin (cyanogenic glycoside) that can release cyanide when chewed. | Consume only roasted, salted, or candied nuts. |\n| | Raw almonds in large amounts | Can cause mild nausea in sensitive people. | Stick to moderation. |\n| **Citrus** | Raw orange peel (in large amounts) | Contains high levels of essential oils that can irritate the stomach. | Use zest sparingly; avoid eating large quantities. |\n| **Herbs & spices** | Raw rhubarb leaves | Contain oxalic acid, can be toxic. | Only use the stalks; discard leaves. |\n| | Raw turmeric (in very large amounts) | Can irritate the stomach or cause mild nausea. | Use the powder normally; don’t consume huge raw quantities. |\n| | Raw cloves | High in eugenol; can irritate the mouth and GI tract in large doses. | Use as a seasoning; avoid eating whole cloves raw in large amounts. |\n| | Raw garlic (large amounts) | Can cause heartburn, GI upset, or blood thinning in high doses. | Use in cooked dishes or as a seasoning; moderate use. |\n| **Dairy** | Unpasteurized milk, cheese, or yogurt | Risk of *Listeria*, *E. coli*, *Salmonella*. | Always use pasteurized products, especially for infants, pregnant women, and immunocompromised people. |\n| | Raw, unheated eggs | Salmonella risk. | Use pasteurized eggs, or cook until yolk and whites are firm. |\n| | Raw cheese made from unpasteurized milk | Same *Listeria* risk; also risk of *C. botulinum* in soft cheeses. | Use only pasteurized or properly aged cheeses. |\n| **Fish & seafood** | Raw shellfish (clams, oysters) | Can harbor *Vibrio* or *S. aureus* toxins. | Cook thoroughly to 145 °F (63 °C). |\n| | Raw fish for sushi/ sashimi | Risk of parasites or bacterial contamination. | Use only sashimi‑grade fish, sourced from reputable suppliers. |\n| | Raw fish containing high mercury (shark, swordfish) | Can lead to neuro‑toxicity. | Limit consumption of high‑mercury fish; prefer low‑mercury species (tilapia, salmon). |\n| **Meat** | Raw ground beef, pork, lamb | Risk of *E. coli*, *Salmonella*, *Trichinella*. | Cook to safe internal temperatures: 160 °F (71 °C) for ground meats, 145 °F (63 °C) for whole cuts. |\n| | Raw poultry | Risk of *Campylobacter*, *Salmonella*. | Cook to 165 °F (74 °C); never consume raw or under‑cooked. |\n| **Misc.** | Raw honey in infants (< 1 yr) | Can contain *C. botulinum* spores. | Avoid feeding honey to babies under 12 months. |\n| | Raw soy sauce or miso in large amounts | High sodium can cause fluid retention or hypertension in sensitive individuals. | Use sparingly. |\n| | Raw sugar (e.g., raw cane sugar) | Rare but can carry contaminants; not a typical poison risk. | Safe when cooked. |\n\n### Quick safety reminders\n1. **Cook thoroughly** – Many toxins are destroyed by heat (e.g., lectins in beans, cyanide in cassava, bacterial pathogens in meats).\n2. **Wash and peel** – Remove skins, peels, or outer layers that may contain higher toxin concentrations (e.g., rhubarb leaves, cassava skin).\n3. **Store correctly** – Keep perishable items in the fridge or freezer; do not leave raw foods at room temperature for extended periods.\n4. **Check for allergies** – Even non‑toxic ingredients can cause severe allergic reactions in some people; be mindful of known allergens.\n5. **When in doubt, discard** – If you’re uncertain about an ingredient’s safety (especially wild mushrooms, unpasteurized products, or unfamiliar spices), throw it out.\n6. **Use reputable suppliers** – Buy foods from trusted sources, especially for raw or minimally processed items.\n\n### Bottom line\nMost kitchen staples are safe when prepared correctly. The biggest risks come from **raw** or **under‑cooked** foods and from certain **wild or unprocessed** items. By following proper cooking, washing, and storage guidelines—and by being cautious with exotic or unfamiliar ingredients—you can minimize the chances of accidental poisoning and keep everyone safe. If you ever suspect you or someone else might have consumed a toxic ingredient, seek medical help promptly.",
