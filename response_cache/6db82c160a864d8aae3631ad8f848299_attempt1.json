  "response": "Below is a **ready‑to‑copy** recipe you can drop into almost any game‑or‑simulation project that needs a “stay‑away‑from‑the‑bomb” routine.\n\n> **TL;DR** – Treat the bomb(s) as obstacles with a *blast radius* and run a shortest‑path search (BFS/ A*).  The agent moves step by step, never stepping into a forbidden cell.  If no safe path exists, the agent simply “waits” (or chooses the safest alternative).  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Problem Summary (What we’re solving)\n\n| Element | Meaning | Typical data type |\n|---------|---------|-------------------|\n| **Grid** | 2‑D map where each cell is walkable or blocked | `int[][]` or `boolean[][]` |\n| **Bomb** | A single cell that *explodes* after a countdown | `Point` (row,col) |\n| **Blast radius** | Manhattan distance from bomb that is lethal | `int` |\n| **Player** | Agent that can move 4‑directions (or 8‑if you want diagonals) | `Point` |\n| **Goal** | Reach a target *without* ever entering a blast‑zone before the bomb detonates | `Point` |\n\n> **Assumption** – The bomb explodes *once* after a known `T` ticks.  \n> **Extension** – If the bomb can detonate earlier (e.g. by stepping onto it), the same logic applies; you just treat the cell as forbidden at *any* time.\n\n---\n\n## 2. High‑Level Algorithm\n\n1. **Mark forbidden cells**  \n   * For each bomb, flag all cells within `radius` as *dangerous*.\n2. **Run a path‑finding search**  \n   * Use BFS (or A* if you have heuristics) to find the shortest safe path from `player` to `goal` that never visits a dangerous cell.\n3. **Execute the path**  \n   * Move the player step by step.  \n   * If the path is empty (no safe route), either stop or pick a “best‑effort” path that stays as far from danger as possible.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Code Example (Python)\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Set\n\n# ---- 1. Data structures ---------------------------------------------\nGrid = List[List[int]]   # 0 = free, 1 = solid wall\n\nPoint = Tuple[int, int]  # (row, col)\n\ndef mark_dangerous(\n    grid: Grid,\n    bombs: List[Point],\n    blast_radius: int\n) -> Set[Point]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a set of cells that are inside any bomb's blast radius.\n    \"\"\"\n    dangerous = set()\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n\n    for br, bc in bombs:\n        for dr in range(-blast_radius, blast_radius + 1):\n            for dc in range(-blast_radius, blast_radius + 1):\n                if abs(dr) + abs(dc) <= blast_radius:        # Manhattan\n                    r, c = br + dr, bc + dc\n                    if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols:\n                        dangerous.add((r, c))\n    return dangerous\n\ndef bfs_safe_path(\n    grid: Grid,\n    start: Point,\n    goal: Point,\n    dangerous: Set[Point]\n) -> List[Point]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Breadth‑first search that never steps into a dangerous cell.\n    Returns the list of points from start to goal (inclusive),\n    or an empty list if no path exists.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    dirs = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]            # 4‑neighbourhood\n\n    queue = deque([start])\n    came_from = {start: None}\n    visited = {start}\n\n    while queue:\n        cur = queue.popleft()\n        if cur == goal:\n            # Reconstruct path\n            path = []\n            while cur is not None:\n                path.append(cur)\n                cur = came_from[cur]\n            return path[::-1]                      # reverse\n\n        for dr, dc in dirs:\n            nr, nc = cur[0] + dr, cur[1] + dc\n            nxt = (nr, nc)\n            if (\n                0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and\n                grid[nr][nc] == 0 and          # walkable\n                nxt not in dangerous and\n                nxt not in visited\n            ):\n                visited.add(nxt)\n                came_from[nxt] = cur\n                queue.append(nxt)\n\n    # No safe path found\n    return []\n\n# ---- 4. Example usage -----------------------------------------------\ndef main():\n    # Example 5x5 grid (0 = free, 1 = wall)\n    g = [\n        [0,0,0,0,0],\n        [0,1,1,1,0],\n        [0,0,0,1,0],\n        [0,1,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,0,0],\n    ]\n    player = (0, 0)\n    goal   = (4, 4)\n    bombs  = [(2, 2)]          # one bomb in the middle\n    blast_radius = 1           # Manhattan distance 1\n\n    dangerous_cells = mark_dangerous(g, bombs, blast_radius)\n    path = bfs_safe_path(g, player, goal, dangerous_cells)\n\n    if path:\n        print(\"Safe path found:\", path)\n    else:\n        print(\"No safe route – you have to wait or choose another plan.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### What the code does\n\n| Step | Code block | Purpose |\n|------|------------|---------|\n| **`mark_dangerous`** | Computes every cell that would be hit by the bomb (Manhattan radius) and stores them in a set. | Fast O(bombs * radius²) lookup during BFS. |\n| **`bfs_safe_path`** | Classic BFS that ignores walls and dangerous cells. | Guarantees the shortest safe path if one exists. |\n| **`main`** | Sets up a small demo grid, runs the algorithm, and prints the result. | Quick sanity check. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Adapting to Your Situation\n\n| Requirement | How to tweak the snippet |\n|-------------|--------------------------|\n| **Diagonal movement** | Add the four diagonal directions to `dirs`. |\n| **Multiple bombs with different radii** | Pass a list of `(Point, int)` pairs to `mark_dangerous`. |\n| **Dynamic bomb countdown** | Re‑run `bfs_safe_path` each tick if the bomb’s blast radius shrinks or expands. |\n| **Real‑time game loop** | Call `bfs_safe_path` once, then each frame just move one step from the pre‑computed `path`. |\n| **Non‑grid environments** | Replace grid checks with your physics engine’s collision tests. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. If “not kame” was a typo for **“no Kamehameha”**…\n\nIf you were actually referring to the *Dragon Ball* “Kamehameha” technique (a powerful energy blast), the same logic applies: treat the blast zone as an expanding *danger area* and plan a route that never enters it until it has vanished.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Quick‑Start Checklist\n\n1. **Define your map** – 2‑D array or graph structure.  \n2. **Place bombs** – List of coordinates and radii.  \n3. **Call `mark_dangerous`** to get the forbidden zone.  \n4. **Call `bfs_safe_path`** with start/goal.  \n5. **Move the player along the returned path** (or handle “no path” case).  \n\nThat’s all!  Plug in the snippet, adjust as needed, and your agent will never get caught in the blast. Happy coding!",
