  "response": "It sounds like you’re looking for a quick “red‑flag” list of ingredients that can turn a recipe or formulation into a poison if you’re not careful. Below is a mix of food‑borne toxins, naturally toxic plant parts, and commonly used cosmetic/cleaning ingredients that can become hazardous when misused. I’ll give you the ingredient, the main danger, and a short safety tip for each.  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Food & Culinary Ingredients  \n\n| Ingredient | Toxic Part / Condition | Why it’s dangerous | Quick Safety Tip |\n|------------|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------|\n| **Rhubarb leaves** | Oxalic acid & anthraquinone glycosides | Causes vomiting, kidney damage, or death if ingested in large amounts | Only use the stalks; keep leaves away from children. |\n| **Cassava (yuca)** | Cyanogenic glucosides (amygdalin) | Releases cyanide if not properly peeled, soaked, or cooked | Peel, soak in water for >12 h, and boil thoroughly (≥30 min). |\n| **Raw kidney beans** | Phaseolamin (a lectin) | Causes severe stomach upset and can be lethal in large doses | Boil for 10 min, discard water, then re‑boil for 20 min. |\n| **Pistachio shells** | Toxic alkaloids | Can cause nausea, vomiting | Use only the nuts; discard shells. |\n| **Blue corn tortilla chips (some brands)** | Oxalic acid (in the corn) | Excessive consumption can lead to kidney stones | Consume in moderation, especially if you have a history of kidney issues. |\n| **Mushrooms (wild)** | Variety of toxins (e.g., amatoxins) | Fatal if ingested | Only use commercially cultivated, well‑identified varieties. |\n| **Poppy seed oil** | Trace opiates | Can trigger false-positive drug tests | Use only food‑grade, processed oil; keep in a sealed container. |\n| **Certain spices (e.g., nutmeg)** | Myristicin in large doses | Hallucinations, vomiting | Use in moderation; 1–2 g (½ tsp) per serving is safe. |\n| **Raw poultry or eggs** | Salmonella, Campylobacter | Food poisoning | Cook to 74 °C (165 °F) for poultry, 71 °C (160 °F) for eggs. |\n| **Seafood (e.g., shellfish)** | Shellfish toxins (e.g., paralytic shellfish poisoning) | Can be fatal | Source from reputable suppliers; check local advisories. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Cosmetic / Household Ingredients  \n\n| Ingredient | Toxicity Issue | Why it can become hazardous | Safety Note |\n|------------|----------------|-----------------------------|-------------|\n| **Phenol** | Skin/eye irritant, systemic toxicity | Used in cleaning & cosmetic products; small amounts can cause burns | Keep away from skin; wear gloves and eye protection. |\n| **Parabens (methylparaben, propylparaben)** | Hormone disruption in high doses | Concentrated formulations can leach into skin | Use in limited amounts; follow FDA guidelines. |\n| **Sodium hydroxide (lye)** | Extremely caustic | Used in soap making; can cause severe burns | Add slowly to water; wear protective gear. |\n| **Acetone** | Highly flammable, neurotoxic | Inhalation in large amounts causes dizziness, headaches | Use in well‑ventilated areas; keep away from heat sources. |\n| **Ethanol (industrial grade)** | Methanol contamination risk | Impurities can cause blindness or death | Use only food‑grade ethanol for consumables. |\n| **Chlorine bleach** | Chlorine gas release | Mixing with ammonia or acids releases toxic gas | Never mix bleach with other cleaners. |\n| **Heavy metal–containing dyes (e.g., some red food dyes)** | Lead, cadmium | Can accumulate over time | Use certified, food‑grade dyes. |\n| **Synthetic fragrance oils** | Allergic reactions, irritants | Some contain phthalates | Use at recommended dilution; patch‑test first. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. General “Avoid/Handle With Care” Tips  \n\n1. **Label everything** – Always label containers with the ingredient name, concentration, and “hazard” symbol if needed.  \n2. **Store in proper containers** – Use food‑grade, BPA‑free bottles for consumable liquids; use industrial containers for chemicals.  \n3. **Use protective equipment** – Gloves, goggles, face shields, and respirators as appropriate.  \n4. **Keep children & pets away** – Store all hazardous ingredients out of reach.  \n5. **Follow local regulations** – Some substances require special permits or handling certifications.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Decision Checklist\n\n| Decision | Question | Action |\n|----------|----------|--------|\n| Is the ingredient naturally toxic? | Does it contain known toxins (e.g., cyanide, lectins, oxalates)? | Ensure proper processing (peel, soak, cook) or avoid it entirely. |\n| Is the ingredient used in high concentration? | Does it exceed regulatory limits (e.g., phenol, parabens)? | Dilute to below the threshold or replace with safer alternative. |\n| Is the ingredient likely to react with others? | Could it produce toxic gas (e.g., bleach + ammonia)? | Never mix; use separate storage and application areas. |\n| Is the ingredient regulated for food use? | Is it labeled “food‑grade” or “cosmetic‑grade”? | Use only food‑grade for consumables; cosmetic‑grade for topical use. |\n\n---\n\n### Want More Detail?\n\n- **Food safety**: Check the USDA or local health department for guidelines on raw beans, cassava, and seafood handling.  \n- **Cosmetic regulations**: Refer to the FDA’s “Cosmetics Regulations” and the EU’s “Cosmetic Regulation 1223/2009.”  \n- **Chemical safety**: Look up the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for each chemical; it contains detailed hazard, handling, and first‑aid information.\n\n---\n\nIf you have a specific product (e.g., a soup, a lotion, a cleaning spray) or a particular ingredient you’re unsure about, let me know! I can give you a more tailored risk assessment and safer alternatives.",
