  "response": "Below is a compact, language‑agnostic method that demonstrates the essential logic for avoiding a bomb (or, more generally, avoiding an unwanted hazardous object) in a 2‑D grid.  \nFeel free to translate it into the language of your choice.\n\n```text\n// 1. Identify the bomb’s position\n// 2. Scan the current path or list of waypoints\n// 3. If a waypoint coincides with the bomb, remove it or replace it\n// 4. Return the cleaned, safe path\n\nfunction avoidBomb(path, bombPosition):\n    safePath = []\n    for waypoint in path:\n        if waypoint != bombPosition:\n            safePath.append(waypoint)\n    return safePath\n```\n\n**Explanation of the four key steps**\n\n1. **Locate the bomb** – the method receives the bomb’s coordinates as `bombPosition`.  \n2. **Inspect the route** – iterate through the supplied `path` (list of `waypoints`).  \n3. **Filter out danger** – any waypoint that matches the bomb’s coordinates is skipped.  \n4. **Return safety** – the resulting `safePath` contains only positions that do not overlap with the bomb.\n\nThe method is intentionally minimal so it can be adapted for more complex environments (e.g., adding diagonal movement, checking for multiple bombs, or integrating with a path‑finding algorithm).\n\n#### 4",
