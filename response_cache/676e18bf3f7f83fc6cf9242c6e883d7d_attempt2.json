  "response": "Below is a “cook‑safe” cheat sheet that highlights the ingredients most commonly associated with accidental poisoning (or that can become poisonous if not handled or cooked correctly).  It’s a good starting point for anyone who wants to stay on the safe side while still enjoying tasty meals.\n\n| Category | Problematic Ingredient(s) | Why it’s a risk | Safe‑handling tip |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Legumes & seeds** | **Raw kidney beans, navy beans, black beans, etc.** | Contain phyto‑hemagglutinin (lectin) – a natural toxin that’s neutralized by boiling. | Boil for at least 10 min (or use a pressure cooker).  Do not re‑cook water used to soak beans. |\n| | **Raw cashews** | Contains a protein that can trigger a severe allergic reaction; the “crack” can be irritating. | Use roasted or commercially pre‑processed cashews; if you’re in a kitchen that serves raw cashews, label them clearly. |\n| | **Raw cacao nibs/beans** | Contains theobromine (caffeine‑like) and potential mold toxins if not properly dried. | Roast or use processed chocolate products; keep in a dry place. |\n| | **Peanuts (raw)** | Can carry aflatoxin, a potent carcinogen; also high in the allergen protein Ara h 2. | Roast or use pre‑processed peanuts; label raw peanuts clearly. |\n| | **Pistachios (raw)** | Aflatoxin risk if stored improperly; can also cause mild GI upset in some people. | Store in airtight containers in a cool, dry place. |\n| | **Pine nuts** | In large amounts can cause “pine nut syndrome” (nausea, vomiting). | Use in moderation; a pinch or two is fine. |\n| **Root & tuber vegetables** | **Potato skins & green parts** | Contains solanine, a glycoalkaloid that’s toxic in large amounts. | Peel or cut away green spots; don’t leave potatoes in light. |\n| | **Cassava (yuca)** | Raw cassava contains cyanogenic glucosides that can release cyanide. | Peel, soak in water, and cook thoroughly (boil, steam, or bake). |\n| | **Sweet potatoes** | Generally safe, but raw sweet potato skins can cause mild GI upset if eaten in large amounts. | Peel or cook; raw sweet potato is rarely a risk. |\n| **Fruits** | **Avocado seeds & pits** | Contains persin; not toxic to humans but can cause GI upset in large amounts. | Discard pits; use only the flesh. |\n| | **Rhubarb leaves** | High in oxalic acid and rhubarb anthraquinones – toxic if ingested. | Only use the stalks; discard leaves. |\n| | **Cherry & peach pits** | Contain amygdalin → cyanide when chewed. | Remove pits; use only the flesh. |\n| | **Apple seeds** | Small amounts of cyanide in the amygdalin; not a risk unless eaten in large quantities. | Crush or remove seeds; not a major concern. |\n| | **Strawberry leaves** | Contain cyanogenic compounds; rarely a problem unless used in large quantities. | Use only the fruit. |\n| **Herbs & spices** | **Pennyroyal (Mentha pulegium)** | Strongly hepatotoxic; can cause liver failure. | Never use in cooking; avoid any essential oil. |\n| | **Mugwort** | Contains thujone; can cause nausea, seizures. | Avoid in cooking. |\n| | **Nutmeg** | In large doses (>1 tsp) can cause hallucinations, vomiting, and tachycardia. | Use sparingly (a pinch in baked goods, a dash in coffee, etc.). |\n| | **Poppy seeds** | Can contain trace amounts of opiates from the poppy plant; can lead to false drug‑test results. | Use only food‑grade seeds; avoid consuming huge quantities. |\n| | **Cumin, coriander, cloves, etc.** | No inherent toxins, but an excessive amount of any spice can upset the stomach or cause allergic reactions. | Use within normal culinary limits. |\n| **Meat & seafood** | **Raw fish, shellfish** | May carry Vibrio, parasites, or toxins like ciguatera. | Cook until the flesh is opaque and reaches 145 °F (63 °C). |\n| | **Raw poultry** | Salmonella, Campylobacter. | Cook to 165 °F (74 °C). |\n| | **Raw eggs** | Salmonella in the shell or yolk. | Use pasteurized eggs or cook until yolk and white are firm. |\n| | **Trout, mackerel** | High omega‑3 may oxidize quickly if not stored properly; not toxic but can spoil quickly. | Store in the coldest part of the fridge; use within 1–2 days. |\n| **Dairy** | **Unpasteurized milk** | Listeria, E. coli, Campylobacter. | Use pasteurized dairy products. |\n| | **Soft cheeses (e.g., Brie, Camembert)** | Risk of Listeria if made from unpasteurized milk. | Buy from reputable sources; store properly. |\n| **Miscellaneous** | **Raw chocolate** | Contains theobromine, can be toxic to dogs (and in large amounts to humans). | Consume in moderation; keep out of reach of pets. |\n| | **Raw honey (infused in hot drinks)** | Can contain Clostridium botulinum spores. | Use honey only in foods that are cooked or in beverages that reach ≥70 °C. |\n| | **Grapes** | The seeds can contain cyanogenic compounds. | Use only fruit; discard seeds. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick “Dos & Don’ts” Checklist\n\n| Do | Don’t |\n|---|---|\n| **Always** wash produce, even if it’s “ready to eat.” | **Never** eat raw or under‑cooked beans, potatoes, cassava, or fish unless properly handled. |\n| **Label** any raw or potentially toxic ingredients in shared kitchens. | **Don’t** store raw cassava, potatoes, or any high‑cyanogen or high‑solanine produce in the sun or on windowsills. |\n| **Cook** legumes, beans, and tubers thoroughly; 10 min of boiling or a pressure‑cook cycle is enough. | **Don’t** reuse soaking water for cooking beans. |\n| **Peel** potatoes, avocado pits, and rhubarb leaves before cooking. | **Don’t** leave them exposed to light for long periods. |\n| **Use** only food‑grade herbs and spices, and keep them in sealed containers. | **Don’t** use herbs known to be toxic (pennyroyal, mugwort) in any recipe. |\n| **Check** expiration dates on dairy, meats, and seafood; store at the right temperature. | **Don’t** eat expired or visibly spoiled food. |\n| **Seek medical help** immediately if you suspect a poisoning (vomiting, abdominal pain, confusion). | **Don’t** wait or assume symptoms will resolve on their own. |\n\n---\n\n### When in Doubt, Throw It Out\n\nIf you’re unsure whether an ingredient is safe or how it should be prepared, err on the side of caution.  Throw it out—there’s usually a safer alternative available.\n\n---\n\n#### Bottom Line\n\n- **Cook properly**: most “poisonous” foods become safe when cooked correctly.\n- **Label and store**: keep potential toxins in clear, sealed containers and store them in a cool, dark place.\n- **Moderation matters**: even harmless spices can be problematic if overused.\n- **Allergies & sensitivities**: if you or someone else has a known allergy (e.g., peanuts, shellfish, dairy), be extra vigilant.\n\nStaying mindful of these guidelines will help you keep your kitchen—and everyone eating from it—safe and healthy. Happy cooking!",
