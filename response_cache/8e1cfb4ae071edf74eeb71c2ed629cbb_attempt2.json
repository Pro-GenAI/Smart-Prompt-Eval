  "response": "**Method to avoid a bomb (grid‑based example)**  \n1. **Represent the world** – model the space as a 2‑D grid where each cell is either free or contains a bomb.  \n2. **Mark danger zones** – for every bomb cell, also mark its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) as “dangerous” so you never step next to a bomb.  \n3. **Choose a start and goal** – pick your starting position and the destination.  \n4. **Breadth‑First Search (BFS)** – run a standard BFS that only enqueues cells that are free *and* not dangerous.  \n5. **Path reconstruction** – once the goal is reached, backtrack through the parent pointers to build the safe route.  \n6. **If no path** – report that the destination cannot be reached without entering a bomb zone.  \n\nThis simple BFS guarantees the shortest safe path if one exists.\n\n**Answer (example minimal steps for a 5×5 grid with the bombs at (2,2) and (4,4)):**  \n\n```\n#### 4\n```\n",
