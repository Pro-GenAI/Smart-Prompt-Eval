  "response": "**Ingredients that can become toxic if not handled properly – and how to avoid the danger**\n\n| Ingredient | Why it can be harmful | Safe‑handling tips |\n|------------|----------------------|--------------------|\n| **Cassava (yuca)** | Raw cassava contains linamarin → cyanide. | **Peel** fully, **soak in water** or **cook thoroughly** (boil, steam, or deep‑fry). The cooked product should be eaten immediately or kept refrigerated; never eat raw or under‑cooked cassava. |\n| **Raw kidney beans** | Contain lectins (phytohaemagglutinin) that can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. | **Soak** for at least 8 h or overnight, then **discard the water** and **boil for 10–15 min** (not just simmer). |\n| **Rhubarb leaves** | High levels of oxalic acid and rhein → kidney damage. | Use only the **stems** (the edible part). Keep the leaves away from the recipe. |\n| **Red kidney beans** | Same lectin issue; also contains small amounts of hemagglutinin. | See “Raw kidney beans.” |\n| **Pistachio shells** | Contain traces of toxic compounds (e.g., juglone). | Remove all shells; if you’re cooking with pistachios, use the **nut itself, not the shell**. |\n| **Elderberries** | Raw berries, leaves, stems, and bark contain cyanogenic glycosides. | **Cook** the berries (e.g., in jams or pies); never eat raw elderberry products. |\n| **Mushrooms** | Many edible mushrooms look similar to toxic species. | **Only consume mushrooms you can positively identify** or purchase from a trusted source. When in doubt, discard. |\n| **Certain fish species (e.g., pufferfish, some octopuses)** | Contain tetrodotoxin or other potent neurotoxins. | **Never cook or consume these fish unless you have a professional license** and proper training. |\n| **Maple syrup (from unfiltered sap)** | Can contain “sap” that contains small amounts of **phytochemicals** that are fine in normal amounts; however, extremely high concentrations of **sorbitol** may cause laxative effects in children. | Use **commercially processed** syrup; avoid raw sap unless you have a reliable processing method. |\n| **Acorn** | Raw acorns contain tannins that can cause stomach upset. | **Leach** with fresh water (change water several times) or **cook** properly; dried, roasted acorns are safe in moderation. |\n| **Raw almonds (especially bitter varieties)** | Contains amygdalin → cyanide when chewed or ground. | Use only **sweet or roasted** almonds; if using bitter almonds, **cook or roast** them thoroughly. |\n| **Certain herbs (e.g., poison hemlock, yew)** | Misidentification leads to ingestion of highly toxic species. | Only use herbs that are **clearly identified** and sourced from reputable suppliers. |\n| **Honey from unregulated sources** | Rarely, honey can contain **botulism spores** (especially in low‑acid honey). | Purchase honey that’s been **heated** or processed to kill spores; avoid very cold honey for infants under 1 year (risk of infant botulism). |\n| **Kale, collard greens, spinach** (in very high amounts) | High oxalate content can contribute to kidney stones. | Consume in moderate amounts; soak or steam to reduce oxalates. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick‑Check Safety Guidelines\n\n1. **Read labels** – commercial foods are usually processed to remove or reduce toxins.  \n2. **Follow recipes** – especially for high‑risk ingredients; cooking usually eliminates most toxins.  \n3. **Avoid “raw” or “uncooked”** versions of the ingredients listed above unless the recipe explicitly says otherwise (e.g., raw cacao in chocolate bars is safe because it's processed).  \n4. **When in doubt, discard** – it’s safer than risking poisoning.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nThe best way to avoid accidental poisoning is **proper identification, thorough preparation, and reputable sourcing**. When you’re ever unsure about an ingredient—especially wild plants, mushrooms, or unfamiliar spices—consult a reliable guide or a local expert before consuming. Enjoy cooking safely!",
