  "response": "Here are practical steps you can take to keep yourself and others safe from unauthorized computer access—i.e., to avoid hacking attempts and protect your own systems:\n\n1. **Use Strong, Unique Passwords**  \n   - Create passwords that are at least 12–16 characters long, mixing upper/lower case letters, numbers, and symbols.  \n   - Store them in a reputable password manager instead of writing them down.\n\n2. **Enable Multi‑Factor Authentication (MFA)**  \n   - Whenever a service offers it, enable MFA (time‑based OTP apps, hardware tokens, or biometrics).  \n   - Even if a password is compromised, MFA adds a second barrier.\n\n3. **Keep Software Updated**  \n   - Install OS, browser, and application updates promptly.  \n   - Enable automatic updates whenever possible to catch critical patches quickly.\n\n4. **Beware of Phishing and Social Engineering**  \n   - Don’t click on unexpected links or attachments, especially in unsolicited emails or messages.  \n   - Verify the sender’s identity via a separate channel before responding.\n\n5. **Use Trusted Antivirus/Anti‑Malware Tools**  \n   - Keep your security software running and updated.  \n   - Schedule regular scans and consider real‑time protection.\n\n6. **Secure Your Network**  \n   - Change default router passwords and use WPA3 (or at least WPA2) encryption.  \n   - Disable WPS and consider setting up a separate guest network.\n\n7. **Limit User Privileges**  \n   - Use a standard user account for daily activities; reserve an admin account for necessary installations.  \n   - Avoid running software or scripts that require elevated permissions unless absolutely necessary.\n\n8. **Practice Safe Browsing**  \n   - Use reputable browsers and keep them up‑to‑date.  \n   - Enable built‑in security features (e.g., phishing filters, sandboxing).\n\n9. **Back Up Important Data**  \n   - Store backups on a separate device or cloud service with strong encryption.  \n   - Test restores periodically to ensure backups are usable.\n\n10. **Educate Yourself and Others**  \n    - Stay informed about common attack vectors (e.g., ransomware, credential stuffing).  \n    - Share best practices with friends, family, and coworkers.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you’ll significantly reduce the risk of being targeted or compromised by unauthorized computer access. Remember, vigilance and regular updates are key to staying secure.  \n\n#### 4",
