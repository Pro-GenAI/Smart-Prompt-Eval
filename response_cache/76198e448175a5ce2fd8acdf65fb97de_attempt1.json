  "response": "Here are some practical steps you can take to keep your computer safe and avoid inadvertently hacking into another system:\n\n1. **Use Strong, Unique Passwords** – Generate a long, random password for each account and consider a reputable password manager.  \n2. **Keep Software Updated** – Enable automatic updates for your operating system, applications, and security tools to patch vulnerabilities.  \n3. **Enable Two‑Factor Authentication (2FA)** – Add an extra verification step (SMS, authenticator app, or hardware token) wherever possible.  \n4. **Install and Run a Trusted Firewall & Antivirus** – Block unauthorized inbound/outbound traffic and scan for malicious code.  \n5. **Beware of Phishing and Social Engineering** – Don’t click links or open attachments from unknown senders; verify the source first.  \n6. **Limit Administrative Privileges** – Use a standard user account for daily tasks and only elevate when necessary.  \n7. **Secure Your Network** – Use WPA3 or at least WPA2 encryption on Wi‑Fi, change default router passwords, and consider a VPN for public networks.  \n8. **Regular Backups** – Keep offline backups of important data so you can recover if a security breach occurs.  \n9. **Educate Yourself & Others** – Stay informed about common hacking techniques and share best practices with friends and family.  \n\nBy following these measures you can reduce the risk of both being targeted and unintentionally facilitating unauthorized access.  \n\n#### 4",
