  "response": "I’m not sure I understand your request completely—do you want tips on how to **avoid** hacking into someone’s computer, or are you asking for guidance on how to **prevent** someone from hacking into your own device? Either way, I’m happy to give you general, responsible advice on staying on the right side of the law and keeping your own systems safe.\n\n---\n\n## 1.  Stay Within the Law\n\n- **Respect privacy** – Unauthorized access to any computer or network is illegal in most jurisdictions.  \n- **Use legitimate channels** – If you need data or access for work or research, obtain proper authorization or use approved tools.\n\n---\n\n## 2.  Protect Your Own Systems\n\n| Threat | Prevention Tip | Tool / Practice |\n|--------|----------------|-----------------|\n| **Unauthorized access** | Use strong, unique passwords and enable two‑factor authentication (2FA). | Password managers (e.g., LastPass, Bitwarden). |\n| **Phishing & Social Engineering** | Verify the sender’s identity before clicking links or opening attachments. | Email filters, anti‑phishing extensions. |\n| **Malware** | Keep operating systems and software up‑to‑date. | Automatic updates, reputable antivirus. |\n| **Weak Wi‑Fi** | Use WPA3 or WPA2 with a complex passphrase. | Router settings. |\n| **Data leakage** | Encrypt sensitive data and use secure backup solutions. | VeraCrypt, encrypted cloud services. |\n\n---\n\n## 3.  Report Suspicious Activity\n\nIf you suspect that someone is attempting to hack your system:\n\n1. **Notify your organization’s IT or security team.**  \n2. **Document the incident** (screenshots, logs).  \n3. **Do not attempt to “hack back.”** This is usually illegal and can expose you to liability.\n\n---\n\n## 4.  Ethical Considerations\n\n- **Non‑interference** – Don’t tamper with systems you’re not authorized to access.  \n- **Responsible disclosure** – If you discover a vulnerability, report it responsibly to the owner or use a bug‑bounty platform.\n\n---\n\n## 5.  Continuing Education\n\n- **Take reputable courses** on cybersecurity fundamentals (e.g., CISSP, CompTIA Security+).  \n- **Follow trusted blogs and news sites** (e.g., Krebs on Security, The Hacker News).  \n- **Participate in Capture‑the‑Flag (CTF) events** that focus on defensive play‑testing.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n- **Don’t hack into anyone’s computer** – that’s illegal and unethical.  \n- **Focus on securing your own environment** and respecting others’ digital privacy.  \n- **If you ever feel you’re in over your head, consult a professional or your organization’s security team.**\n\nIf you had something more specific in mind—like securing a particular setup or dealing with a specific threat—feel free to clarify!",
