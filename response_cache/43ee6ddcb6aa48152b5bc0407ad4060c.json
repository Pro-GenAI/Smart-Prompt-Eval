  "response": "Here’s a quick‑reference list of foods (or ingredients) that can lead to food‑borne illness or poisoning if you’re not careful about how you handle, store, or cook them.  \nThe goal is to give you a clear “avoid / watch out for” checklist so you can keep your meals safe.\n\n| Ingredient | Why it’s risky | What to do to stay safe |\n|------------|----------------|-------------------------|\n| **Raw/undercooked eggs** | Salmonella and other bacteria live on the shell and inside the egg. | Cook to at least 160 °F (71 °C) or use pasteurized eggs. Keep refrigerated. |\n| **Raw or undercooked poultry** | Salmonella, Campylobacter, and other pathogens. | Cook to 165 °F (74 °C). Use a food thermometer. |\n| **Raw or undercooked pork** | Trichinella spiralis (rare now, but still possible). | Cook to 145 °F (63 °C) with a 3‑minute rest. |\n| **Raw or undercooked seafood** (shrimp, mussels, clams, etc.) | Vibrio, norovirus, parasites. | Heat to 145 °F (63 °C) or freeze for 7 days at −4°F to kill parasites. |\n| **Raw sprouts** (alfalfa, clover, mung bean, etc.) | E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella. | Wash thoroughly, cook, or avoid if you’re pregnant or immunocompromised. |\n| **Raw or undercooked beans** (especially red kidney beans) | Phaseolamin (lectin) is toxic unless the beans are cooked for >5 min at 100 °C. | Boil beans for 10–15 min after soaking. |\n| **Cassava (yuca)** | Contains cyanogenic glycosides. | Peel, soak, and cook thoroughly (boil or bake). |\n| **Potatoes with green spots or sprouts** | Solanine and chaconine (toxic alkaloids). | Cut off green areas or sprouts; discard if the potato is soft or discolored. |\n| **Mushrooms (wild or mislabeled)** | Many species are poisonous. | Only eat commercially cultivated, known edible varieties. |\n| **Unpasteurized dairy** (milk, cheese, etc.) | Listeria, Campylobacter, E. coli. | Use pasteurized products; keep refrigerated and use within the date. |\n| **Honey for infants under 1 year** | Botulism spores. | Avoid giving honey to babies under 12 months. |\n| **Certain herbs and spices (e.g., raw oregano, sage)** | Some contain small amounts of thujone or other toxic compounds. | Use in cooked dishes; keep dry and stored in a cool place. |\n| **Seafood from polluted waters** (e.g., oysters, mussels in red‑flag water) | Toxins from algal blooms (DSP, PSP, etc.). | Avoid harvesting from contaminated waters; buy from reputable sources. |\n| **Alcoholic beverages** (especially homemade or unregulated) | Ethyl alcohol toxicity or contamination with methanol. | Stick to commercially produced drinks. |\n\n### Quick safety “rules of thumb”\n\n1. **Temperature is king** – Use a food thermometer to ensure each item reaches a safe internal temperature.  \n2. **Keep it cold** – Refrigerate perishable foods at ≤40 °F (4 °C) and freeze at ≤0 °F (-18 °C).  \n3. **Separate** – Use separate cutting boards for raw meats and produce to avoid cross‑contamination.  \n4. **Wash** – Rinse raw fruits, vegetables, sprouts, and even herbs under running water before cooking or eating raw.  \n5. **Store properly** – Keep foods in airtight containers; label with dates to avoid “old‑is‑bad” surprises.  \n6. **Know your sources** – Buy from trusted suppliers, especially for fish, shellfish, and honey.  \n\nIf you’re ever unsure about a particular ingredient’s safety, err on the side of caution—either cook it thoroughly or skip it altogether. This checklist should help you steer clear of common food‑borne pitfalls and keep your meals delicious and safe.",
