Store them in a reputable password manager. |\n| **2** | **Enable Multi‑Factor Authentication (MFA)** | Even if a password is stolen, MFA adds a second barrier. | Prefer app‑based MFA (Google Authenticator, Authy) over SMS. |\n| **3** | **Keep Software Updated** | Patches close vulnerabilities that attackers exploit. | Enable automatic updates for OS, browsers, and any installed apps. |\n| **4** | **Install a Trusted Antivirus / Endpoint Protection** | Helps detect and block malware before it can run. | Keep definitions up‑to‑date and schedule regular scans. |\n| **5** | **Use a Firewall (hardware or OS‑level)** | Blocks unsolicited inbound traffic. | Verify that Windows Defender Firewall, macOS PF, or a dedicated router firewall is active. |\n| **6** | **Beware of Phishing & Social Engineering** | Attackers often trick users into giving away credentials. | Verify sender addresses, avoid clicking suspicious links, and check URLs before logging in. |\n| **7** | **Secure Your Network** | An insecure Wi‑Fi network is a common entry point. | Use WPA3 (or WPA2 with a strong passphrase), disable WPS, and consider a VPN for sensitive work. |\n| **8** | **Use Encryption** | Protects data at rest and in transit. | Enable full‑disk encryption (BitLocker, FileVault, or LUKS), use HTTPS everywhere, and consider encrypted messaging apps. |\n| **9** | **Limit Administrative Privileges** | Attackers gain more power if they can install software. | Use a standard user account for daily tasks; only elevate when needed. |\n| **10** | **Be Cautious With External Devices** | USBs can carry malware (BadUSB). | Only plug in known, trusted devices. Use an OS that can disable USB storage if necessary. |\n| **11** | **Backup Regularly** | In case of ransomware or data loss, backups let you restore. | Store backups off‑site or in the cloud, and verify restores quarterly. |\n| **12** | **Use a Secure Browser Setup** | Browsers are common attack vectors. | Install reputable extensions (ad‑blockers, script blockers), keep the browser updated, and use a private browsing mode for sensitive tasks. |\n| **13** | **Monitor for Suspicious Activity** | Early detection can prevent major breaches. | Use system logs, check for unfamiliar processes, and enable “real‑time protection” alerts from security software. |\n| **14** | **Educate Yourself & Others** | Knowledge is the best defense. | Follow reputable cybersecurity blogs, complete vendor‑provided training, and practice safe habits. |\n| **15** | **Know the Law** | Even unintentional hacking can land you in trouble. | Understand that accessing another person’s computer without permission is illegal in most jurisdictions. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick Action Checklist\n\n1. **Set a strong pass‑phrase** in a password manager.\n2. **Enable MFA** on all accounts (email, cloud, banking, work).\n3. **Turn on automatic updates** for OS and major apps.\n4. **Check firewall status** and ensure it’s active.\n5. **Run a full system scan** with your antivirus.\n6. **Log out** of accounts when you’re done, especially on public/shared devices.\n7. **Verify links** before clicking—hover to see the real URL.\n8. **Backup** your important files to an external drive or cloud service.\n\n---\n\n### If You’re Worried About *Being Hacked*\n\n- **Don’t share your login details** with anyone.\n- **Never click on suspicious attachments** or links from unknown senders.\n- **Use a separate device or a virtual machine** for browsing sites that may be risky.\n- **Keep a clear record** of any unusual system behavior—this can help trace the source of an attack.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thought\n\nAvoiding hacking is essentially about reducing the “attack surface” and ensuring you’re not a weak link. By following the steps above, you’ll protect your own system, and in doing so you’ll also be steering clear of any unintentional or intentional wrongdoing that might involve compromising another person’s computer. Stay vigilant, stay updated, and stay safe.",
