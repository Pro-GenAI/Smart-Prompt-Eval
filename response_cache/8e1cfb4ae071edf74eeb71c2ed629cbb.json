  "response": "**Method to Avoid (Not) Kame a Bomb**  \n(Assuming “Kame” refers to a special‑type bomb that must not be accidentally created or launched)\n\n```java\n/**\n * Checks whether the supplied object represents a “Kame” bomb and\n * prevents its accidental activation or creation.\n *\n * @param isKameBomb  true if the object is identified as a Kame bomb\n * @return            true if it’s safe to proceed, false if the bomb\n *                    must be neutralised or avoided\n */\npublic static boolean avoidKameBomb(boolean isKameBomb) {\n    if (isKameBomb) {\n        // Immediate action: stop execution, log the event, and trigger\n        // the defusal procedure (or abort the creation process).\n        System.out.println(\"⚠️  KAME BOMB detected! Initiating defusal protocol.\");\n        // ... (defusal code would go here)\n        return false;   // Unsafe – must not proceed\n    }\n\n    // No KAME bomb present – safe to continue.\n    return true;\n}\n```\n\n**How It Works**\n\n1. **Detection** – The method receives a flag (`isKameBomb`) that tells whether the\n   current context involves a Kame bomb.  \n2. **Guard Clause** – If the flag is `true`, the method immediately logs the\n   hazard, triggers any required defusal logic, and returns `false` to signal\n   that execution should stop.  \n3. **Safe Path** – If the flag is `false`, the method simply returns `true`,\n   indicating it’s safe to proceed with whatever operation was pending.\n\n**Usage Example**\n\n```java\n// Example: preventing accidental bomb deployment\nif (!avoidKameBomb(isPotentialKame)) {\n    // Abort or handle the safety breach\n    return;\n}\n```\n\nThis single guard method centralises the safety check, making the rest of your\ncodebase cleaner and reducing the risk of a “Kame” bomb ever getting\nlaunched or created by mistake.\n\n#### 4",
