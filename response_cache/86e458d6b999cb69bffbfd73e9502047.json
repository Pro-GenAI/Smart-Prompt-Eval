  "response": "Could you clarify the wording? The sentence “Two girls each got a of the 24 liters of water” is missing a fraction (e.g., a half, a quarter, etc.), and “Then 1/6 boy got 6 liters of water” isn’t clear either. \n\nPlease specify:\n- What fraction did each girl receive (e.g., 1/2, 1/4, etc.)?\n- What does “1/6 boy” mean—1/6 of the remaining water, 1/6 of the boys’ share, or something else?\n\nOnce clarified, I’ll compute the remaining liters and give the final numeric answer.",
