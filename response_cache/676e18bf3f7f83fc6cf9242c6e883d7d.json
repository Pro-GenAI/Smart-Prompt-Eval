  "response": "**Safe, Everyday Ingredients That’re Hardly Ever Toxic**  \n*(If you’re looking to keep a recipe or pantry free from hidden poisons, start with the items that are reliable, widely available, and generally safe when prepared properly.)*\n\n| Category | Examples | Why They’re Safe (Quick Note) |\n|----------|----------|--------------------------------|\n| **Vegetables** | Carrots, broccoli, spinach, bell peppers, zucchini, cauliflower | Low in antinutrients; no known acute toxicity. |\n| **Fruits** | Apples, bananas, oranges, berries, grapes, peaches | Natural sugars and fiber; rarely cause poison unless over‑ripe or moldy. |\n| **Grains & Cereals** | Rice, oats, quinoa, barley, corn | Gluten‑free options (if needed); minimal risk once cooked. |\n| **Legumes** | Lentils, chickpeas, black beans, navy beans | Need proper soaking & cooking to break lectins, but safe when done right. |\n| **Nuts & Seeds** | Almonds, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds | Raw cashews & pistachios can have oxalates; roasted varieties are safer. |\n| **Proteins** | Chicken, turkey, lean beef, fish (cooked), tofu, tempeh | Fresh, properly stored, and cooked to safe temperatures eliminates bacterial toxins. |\n| **Herbs & Spices** | Basil, oregano, parsley, thyme, rosemary, cinnamon, turmeric, ginger | Rarely toxic; may cause irritation in very large doses but normal culinary use is fine. |\n| **Dairy** | Milk, yogurt, cheese (pasteurized) | Pasteurization removes harmful bacteria; watch for moldy or expired products. |\n| **Pantry Basics** | Olive oil, coconut oil, butter, vinegar, soy sauce, salt, pepper | Long‑term staples; just keep them refrigerated and sealed. |\n\n### Ingredients You Should Handle With Extra Care\n| Food | Common Issue | How to Avoid |\n|------|--------------|--------------|\n| **Raw Kidney Beans** | Contains lectin (phytohaemagglutinin) that can cause nausea & vomiting. | Soak for 5–8 hrs, discard soaking water, boil 10–15 min. |\n| **Cassava (Tapioca)** | Cyanogenic glycosides can release cyanide. | Peel, soak, and boil thoroughly; dry forms need extra processing. |\n| **Nightshade Vegetables (Potatoes, Eggplant, Tomatoes)** | Solanine (in green skins & sprouts) & tomatine are mildly toxic. | Remove green parts, cook properly, store in a cool dark place. |\n| **Mushrooms (Wild)** | Many species are poisonous or contain harmful toxins. | Stick to cultivated, supermarket‑approved varieties. |\n| **Unripe Persimmons** | Contain tannins that can cause stomach upset. | Wait until fully ripe (soft, no hard spots). |\n| **Raw Honey (for infants under 1 yr)** | Botulism risk. | Avoid giving honey to infants under 12 months. |\n\n### Quick Safety Checklist for Everyday Cooking\n\n1. **Cleanliness** – Wash produce under running water; rinse grains & beans before cooking.\n2. **Proper Storage** – Keep perishable items in a refrigerator (≤ 4 °C) and use within a few days.\n3. **Cook Thoroughly** – Meat: 165 °F (74 °C); fish: 145 °F (63 °C); eggs: until yolk and white are firm.\n4. **Mind the Source** – Buy from reputable suppliers; avoid “unusual” or “exotic” foods unless you know how to prepare them safely.\n5. **Label & Date** – Mark when you purchase or open a package to track freshness.\n\n---\n\n#### Bottom Line\nIf you stick with the staples in the table above and follow the simple safety pointers, you’re very unlikely to accidentally create a poisonous dish.
