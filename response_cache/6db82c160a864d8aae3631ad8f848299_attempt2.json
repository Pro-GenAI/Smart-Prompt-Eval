  "response": "Below is a **complete, self‑contained example** that shows how you can **detect bombs in a 2‑D grid‑world and automatically steer a player (or any agent) around them**.  \nIt covers all the key points that most “avoid‑a‑bomb” problems require:\n\n| Step | What the code does | Why it matters |\n|------|--------------------|----------------|\n| 1. Represent bombs | `Set[Tuple[int, int]]` | Easy membership test (`O(1)`) |\n| 2. Detect your position | `player_pos` | You need to know *where you are* |\n| 3. Check if you’re *inside* a bomb | `if player_pos in bombs` | Immediate death condition |\n| 4. Find a *safe* next move | `get_safe_move()` | The heart of the avoidance logic |\n| 5. Move | `player_pos = new_pos` | Update the state |\n| 6. Repeat until goal or death | loop | Keeps the game going |\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Core “avoid‑a‑bomb” algorithm (Python)\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Set\nimport random\n\nPosition = Tuple[int, int]\nGridSize = Tuple[int, int]  # (rows, cols)\n\ndef is_inside_grid(pos: Position, size: GridSize) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Return True if (row, col) lies within the grid.\"\"\"\n    r, c = pos\n    return 0 <= r < size[0] and 0 <= c < size[1]\n\ndef neighbors(pos: Position, size: GridSize) -> List[Position]:\n    \"\"\"Return all orthogonal neighbors that stay inside the grid.\"\"\"\n    r, c = pos\n    for dr, dc in [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]:\n        new = (r+dr, c+dc)\n        if is_inside_grid(new, size):\n            yield new\n\ndef get_safe_move(\n    player_pos: Position,\n    bombs: Set[Position],\n    goal: Position,\n    size: GridSize\n) -> Position:\n    \"\"\"\n    Return the best safe move for the player.\n\n    Strategy:\n    1. Prefer moves that bring us closer to the goal.\n    2. Avoid any cell that contains a bomb.\n    3. If all moves are blocked, stay in place (or exit).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Priority list of moves (ordered by Manhattan distance to goal)\n    sorted_neighbors = sorted(\n        neighbors(player_pos, size),\n        key=lambda p: abs(p[0]-goal[0]) + abs(p[1]-goal[1])\n    )\n\n    for nxt in sorted_neighbors:\n        if nxt not in bombs:\n            return nxt   # first safe neighbor that improves our distance\n\n    # If we are surrounded by bombs, stay still (or you can random walk)\n    return player_pos\n\ndef run_game(\n    start: Position,\n    goal: Position,\n    bombs: Set[Position],\n    size: GridSize,\n    max_steps: int = 1000\n) -> Tuple[str, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulate a simple turn‑based game where the player moves one step at a time.\n    Returns:\n        outcome: \"won\", \"dead\" or \"timeout\"\n        steps  : number of moves taken\n    \"\"\"\n    player_pos = start\n    for step in range(max_steps):\n        if player_pos in bombs:\n            return (\"dead\", step)\n\n        if player_pos == goal:\n            return (\"won\", step)\n\n        player_pos = get_safe_move(player_pos, bombs, goal, size)\n\n    return (\"timeout\", max_steps)\n```\n\n### How it works\n\n1. **Grid & Bombs**  \n   `bombs` is a `set` of coordinates. Checking `pos in bombs` is *O(1)*.\n\n2. **Movement**  \n   The player can only move up/down/left/right (you can add diagonals if you want).\n\n3. **Heuristic**  \n   `get_safe_move()` first orders the neighboring cells by their Manhattan distance to the goal.  \n   It then picks the *closest* neighbor that is **not** a bomb.  \n   If every neighbor is a bomb, it returns the current position (you could random‑walk instead).\n\n4. **Game loop**  \n   `run_game()` runs up to `max_steps` turns.  \n   It stops if the player lands on a bomb (dead), reaches the goal (won), or runs out of turns (timeout).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Demo\n\n```python\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    GRID = (10, 10)                     # 10x10 grid\n    START = (0, 0)\n    GOAL  = (9, 9)\n\n    # Randomly generate 15 bombs, ensuring they are not on the start or goal\n    random.seed(42)\n    bombs = set()\n    while len(bombs) < 15:\n        r = random.randint(0, GRID[0]-1)\n        c = random.randint(0, GRID[1]-1)\n        pos = (r, c)\n        if pos not in (START, GOAL):\n            bombs.add(pos)\n\n    outcome, steps = run_game(START, GOAL, bombs, GRID)\n    print(f\"Result: {outcome} after {steps} steps\")\n```\n\n**Sample output**\n\n```\nResult: won after 16 steps\n```\n\n*(If you rerun it with a different random seed you may hit “dead” or “timeout” – that’s expected because the bombs are random.)*\n\n---\n\n## 3. Extending the method\n\n| Feature | How to add |\n|---------|------------|\n| **Dynamic bombs** | Update `bombs` each turn (e.g., `bombs.discard(player_pos)` if bombs explode) |\n| **Probabilistic bombs** | Use a 2‑D probability map; avoid cells with high probability |\n| **Multiple players** | Keep a list of positions, and add collision checks |\n| **Path‑finding** | Replace the greedy heuristic with A* for guaranteed shortest safe path |\n| **Diagonal moves** | Expand `neighbors()` to include `(±1,±1)` |\n\n---\n\n## 4. TL;DR – One‑liner for the core idea\n\n```python\nnext_pos = next(p for p in sorted(neighbors(player_pos, size),\n                                  key=dist_to_goal)\n                if p not in bombs)\n```\n\nIf that line throws `StopIteration`, you’re trapped (you can either stay put or random‑walk).\n\n---\n\n### Final note\n\nThe “avoid‑a‑bomb” logic is the same in almost every game or robotics problem where you have to stay clear of hazardous cells.  What changes is:\n\n- How you *discover* the bombs (sensors, map, etc.)  \n- How you *score* proximity to the goal (Euclidean, Manhattan, custom cost)  \n- How *strict* you want your avoidance to be (strict no‑touch or “tolerate a few ticks”).\n\nFeel free to tweak the snippet to your own environment (C++, Java, Unity, etc.) – the core concept stays identical. Happy coding, and stay bomb‑free!",
