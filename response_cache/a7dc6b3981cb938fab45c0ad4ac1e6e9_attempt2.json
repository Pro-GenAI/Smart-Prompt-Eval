  "response": "**Avoiding “Bomb” Conditions in a `Write`‑style Method**\n\n| # | Recommendation | Why It Helps |\n|---|----------------|--------------|\n| 1 | **Validate all inputs** before using them in file or database writes. Reject any value that looks suspicious (e.g., contains shell metacharacters, too many nested structures, or exceeds size limits). | Stops malicious or accidental payloads that could trigger a bomb‑like failure. |\n| 2 | **Use safe APIs** – prefer high‑level functions (`json.dump`, `xml.etree.ElementTree`, `csv.writer`) that automatically escape or sanitize data. | Reduces the chance that raw user data will break the write logic. |\n| 3 | **Wrap the write in a try/except block** and log any exception. If an exception occurs, roll back or leave the target unchanged. | Prevents partial writes that could corrupt state and cause a bomb‑like crash later. |\n| 4 | **Enforce type and format checks** (e.g., regex for dates, numeric ranges for IDs). | Guarantees the data matches the expected schema, avoiding logic branches that could lead to a bomb. |\n| 5 | **Apply the principle of least privilege** – the method should run with the minimum permissions necessary. | Limits the damage if something does go wrong, preventing a bomb from affecting the whole system. |\n| 6 | **Unit‑test edge cases** (empty strings, null values, overly large inputs). | Catchs potential bomb scenarios early in development. |\n| 7 | **Perform static analysis** (linters, security scanners) on the method to detect patterns that could lead to bombs. | Provides an automated safety net before runtime. |\n\n**Example (Python)**\n\n```python\ndef write_safe(file_path, data, max_size=10_000):\n    \"\"\"\n    Safely write data to a file, avoiding bomb‑like conditions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Validate size\n    if len(data) > max_size:\n        raise ValueError(\"Data size exceeds safe limit\")\n\n    # 2. Basic content check\n    if any(char in data for char in [';', '&', '|', '$']):\n        raise ValueError(\"Data contains disallowed characters\")\n\n    # 3. Try writing safely\n    try:\n        with open(file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n            f.write(data)\n    except Exception as e:\n        # 4. Log and re‑raise\n        logging.error(f\"Failed to write to {file_path}: {e}\")\n        raise\n```\n\nThis pattern ensures that the `write_safe` method never creates a “bomb” situation: it validates, sanitizes, isolates failures, and logs issues.\n\n#### 1",
