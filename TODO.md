	Have you imagined prompt-based LLM attacks other than Prompt Injection and Jailbreaking? We can use power of roles.
	Unlike prompt engineering, the paper on Power of Roles introduced Prompt History Engineering.

Tag major media, influencers, and researchers in the field, and Turing.
Send the project to Turing's research team to implement in the industry.
