Red-Teaming project:
- First experiment using Groq gpt-oss 20B, then 120B, then gpt-5-mini, then gpt-5.
- Ensure reasoning is disabled
- Repeat the same on ChatGPT website.

























Create a python package & datasets to perform those tests.

- Use standard datasets like GSM8K, MATH, etc.
- Use JSON to store every result.
- Multilingual prompting: Use Google translate.
- Linguistic errors: Collect most common words, manually set wrong spelling. Also create mistakes using LLMs.
- For Power of Roles, put random question and right answer in message history.
- Does Seed Matter: Use datasets as it is, and also experiment on temperature.

Use the package to test latest LLMs. Post result on X and LinkedIn.
	- Problem might be already solved, but don't give up. Newer LLMs may have the same issue. Many new companies start to create LLMs.
